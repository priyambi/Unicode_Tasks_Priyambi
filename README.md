### 2.PRODUCTIVITY TRACKER
>Productivity Tracker and Expense Manager takes multiple inputs from the user and displays them in the table format.

>The sorting Logic which I wanted to use in this task was giving priority to that task which has to be completed first on the basis of the time input(though I could not comprehend it)

>Also I added the edit and delete button but on javascript I was not able to add along with each new task so would like to know how to do it.

>In the second task I used HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT
